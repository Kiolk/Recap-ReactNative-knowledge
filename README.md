# React Native Refresher Plan

## Week 1: Basics and Environment Setup

### Day 1: Setting Up the Development Environment
- Install the latest versions of:
    - **Node.js**
    - **npm** or **Yarn**
    - **React Native CLI** or **Expo CLI** (depending on your preference)
- Set up Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS).
- Test your setup by creating a new React Native app:
  ```bash
  npx react-native init MyApp
  cd MyApp
  npx react-native run-android # or run-ios
  ```
